      <h2>Free music software!</h2>
      <p>As a self-admiring amateur musician, I have always felt that everyone should have the gift of having a chance to learn to play at least one instrument. We live in an age where knowledge has become cheap. The internet allows us to learn almost anything, just through watching the right youtube videos and reading tutorials. What then is holding us all back from learning music and how to play instruments?</p>
      <p>One could say that it is especially difficult to learn an instrument, because one doesn't have an instrument. Luckily, your solution already exists! Starting instruments can be very cheap. A recorder can cost £10 or less, you can buy a cheap classical guitar or keyboard for under £40 and there are many other instruments that you can also get at a tiny price range. Some instruments are entirely free. Your voice is in a way an instrument and you can always sing to your hearts content, or join a band or a choir if you are feeling more adventurous. If you are very poor and your singing is not particularly good, you may be eligible to get a free instrument through various funding schemes and grants such as <a href="http://www.dontstopthemusic.co.uk/">Don't stop the music</a>, or you can make an instrument from almost nothing by following tutorials such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BISrGwN-yH4">this</a>.</p>
