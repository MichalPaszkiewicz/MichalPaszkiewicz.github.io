<h2>What if clocks were Australian</h2>

<p>
	Something I have found throughout my life is that few people question things, fewer people attempt to find the answer, and only a small fraction of those find it.
</p>

<p>
	Simple questions that a child might ask no longer remain interesting to the narrow-minded adult who reserves his thoughts for other things.
	Even if they should really be common knowledge.
</p>

<p>
	One of the questions I have found that prove this is:
</p>

<ul>
	<li><i>Why do clocks go clockwise?</i></li>
</ul>

<p>
	A simple question, with a simple answer, yet <b>most adults cannot answer it satisfactorily</b>.
</p>

<p>
	So why DO clocks go clockwise? Obviously clocks are man-made, so we will need to read some history. 
	The first methods that humans used to measure time were the celestial bodies: the Sun, the Moon and the stars.
	These would have been used for a very long time to figure out the seasons and lengths of time in terms of days or months.
