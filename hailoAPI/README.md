Instructions
============

To run, please cd to this folder then run:

node server.js

The app can then be accessed on:

http://localhost:8000/

Notes
------

I chose to use pure JavaScript for this project to make this a bit more of a challenge.

If you would like me to remake this using Angular, jQuery, TypeScript or d3, please say so.
