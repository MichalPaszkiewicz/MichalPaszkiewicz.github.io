		<p>A lot of good news is always welcome. A lot of good news for Microsoft developers is especially more than welcome! It looks like we are starting to arrive at a new era of Microsoft development, and here I will try to explain what is going on.</p>
		
		<h3>Microsoft is going open source!</h3>
		<p>Many of you already know this, but most people have not heard about this and quite a few people don't really understand the concept of open source.</p>	
	
		<p>Microsoft is currently sticking all of its code on a popular file-sharing site called GitHub. Most C# developers are going berzerk due to the release of the Core CLR code. CLR is the Command Language Runtime and is the engine of all .NET development. For more info, check <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Language_Runtime">this thing</a> out! That's right, please use Wikipedia more. Scott Hanselman, one of my favourite programmers (who is YOUR favourite programmer?) has kindly ran the CoreCLR GitHub repo through Power BI to get us <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/TheNETCoreCLRIsNowOpenSourceSoIRanTheGitHubRepoThroughMicrosoftPowerBI.aspx">some statistics</a>.</p>
		
		<h3>Raspberry Pi 2</h3>
		<p>The <a class="inline-link" href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/raspberry-pi-2-on-sale/">Raspberry Pi 2</a> is now on the market for just $35. This new release may not be exciting for everyone, but Microsoft developers must surely be happy that the newest Pi now has an ARMv7 processor that will work a lot faster and even let you run Microsoft Windows 10! Wowza!</p>

		<h3>Hololens</h3>
		<p>Last, but definitely not least, we are seeing the introduction of the Hololens.</p>
