			After months of trying to organise it, I have finally managed to get my friend <a class="inline-link" title="BackSTABBER" alt="James Luis Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/111922926@N08/">James</a> to take me stargazing (partly through taking his torch hostage). Reaching his house slightly before midnight, we were lucky to be doing this during the Geminid meteor shower, which provided a splendid view of lots of shooting stars and hopefully has meant my wishes may finally come true (come on, world domination). 
		</p>

			Apart from just looking at stars (normally and through James' awesome reflector telescope), I also had the great opportunity to be taught the basics of astrophotography. As the newest blog post, I would like to share with you the photos I took using my Canon 1200D camera.

			Unfortunately, although we saw plenty of meteors during the shower (some very impressive ones too!), I only managed to catch one meteor on camera:

			As well as this, we also directed my camera to Orion, and took a not-so-bar photo of the Orion Nebula:
