      <h2>Quintus and Bing Code Search</h2>
      <p>
        This week has been rather busy, but this hasn't stopped me having a look at two cool things in my spare time - Quintus, the Html5 game engine, and Microsoft's Bing Code Search.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Quintus</h3><a class="link" href="http://www.michalpaszkiewicz.co.uk/platformer">Link</a>
      <p>
        I have only just started learning to use this thing, but I'm already impressed - a hundred lines of code and I have a poorly painted sprite braving a run across a platform that seems to have managed to find a way to make blocks levitate. Now all I need is a scoreboard and It'll be the new flappy bird.

	  <h3>Bing Code Search</h3>
	  <p>Bing Code Search is a great new extension for visual studio that you can find on the visual studio gallery right <a class="inline-link" href="http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/a1166718-a2d9-4a48-a5fd-504ff4ad1b65">here</a>.</p>
	  <p>This awesome new tool increases workers' productivity tenfold by minimising the time taken between starting to write a function and pasting in the correct code from the internet.</p>
	  <p>Lets face it. Most programmers will spend 490% of their lifetime copying and pasting code from <a class="inline-link" href="http://stackoverflow.com/">stackoverflow</a>. Bing code search lets you find the function you are looking for in seconds and paste it in with the click of a button, without ever leaving visual studio!</p>
	  <p>In addition, it has hidden extra features, such as cooking lessons:</p>
