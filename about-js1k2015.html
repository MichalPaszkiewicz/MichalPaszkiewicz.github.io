		<p>
			So this year happens to be the first year where I have decided to take part in the <a target="_blank" class="inline-link" href="http://js1k.com/2015-hypetrain/" alt="JS1k 2015 home page">JS1k competition</a>.
			This is a competition that involves creating a game or other web app in less than a kilobyte of code (this means around less than a thousand letters and numbers).
			This size is of interest to many geeks out there, as files of this size can be sent as a single transmission unit over the internet (i.e. this size of file will take the same amount of time to arrive at a client's browser as it would have if it was just one or two characters long, but if it was longer, it would take twice as long!).
