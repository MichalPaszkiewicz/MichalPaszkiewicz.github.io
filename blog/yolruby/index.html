                    <p>
	So, following my <a href="../yolfortran/index.html">first post</a> from my year-of-languages series of posts (where I learnt some fortran), I decided to try ruby for #2.
</p>
<h2>How I selected a project</h2>
<p>
	Since having analysed my reading speed in the <a href="../yolfortran/index.html">last post in this series</a> (from my goodreads data),
	I have wondered about what else I could see from that data.
	The first thing that sprung to my mind, was that it would be interesting to see if I gave higher ratings to the books I read in comparison to other readers.
	So this was the project that I would put my newly acquired ruby skills to.
</p>
<h2>What I think about Ruby</h2>
<p>
	I like it. 
	I really, really do. 
	I may be slightly annoyed that I have to write "end" all over the place, but there are so many things about the language that make up for this.
	I like the duck typing (yes, I AM one of those weirdos who like JavaScript).
	I like the modules.
	Lambda syntax is neat for multi-line algorithms.
	The libraries are awesome.
	As soon as I touched on the CSV library I was surprised with how easy it was to manipulate CSVs.
	Sure, I may have had some trouble with discovering that I needed to stick ":row_sep => :auto" all over my code, but even then this was a relatively short-lived problem.
	Generally speaking, it was a pleasure writing Ruby code.
</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>
	Once again, I have put this code <a href="https://github.com/MichalPaszkiewicz/yol-ruby">on github</a>. 
	I drew a graph (as always), of my ratings against book number. There was little to be analysed from this, really.
</p>
<h3>My Rating difference to Average Rating of book against book number of the year</h3>
<img src="index.png" class="wide-img">
<p>
	I modified the code to output the average rating difference per genre.
	From this, I found:
</p>
<table>
	<tr>
		<th></th><th>Difference</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Fiction</td><td>+0.270</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Non-Fiction</td><td>+0.313</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Technical</td><td>+0.324</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Total</td><td>+0.304</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>
	Overall, I am a generous reviewer. 
	I am likely to give a book a better rating than the average reader by 0.304 stars.
	Not bad, considering that there are only 5 stars, making this >6% of a better rating.
	I also give more technical books higher ratings - so I clearly must enjoy reading technical books more than other people.
	Or perhaps I am horribly pretentious and scoring more advanced books higher scores to attract attention to the kinds of books I am reading.
</p>
<p>
	I must be a terrible person.
