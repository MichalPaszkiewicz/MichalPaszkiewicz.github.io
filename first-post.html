      <p>
        So, to start this blog off, I'm simply going to explain what projects I have up and going.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Natural selection </h3><a class="link" alt="Simulation of natural selection" href="http://www.michalpaszkiewicz.co.uk/natural-selection/">Link</a>
      <p>
        This is a pretty simple project I started as an experiment with the aim to learn to use Html5 canvas. It is a single page site, with a canvas on it, upon which various balls bounce around. The green balls are supposed to be 'male', the pink are 'female', and the red ball is a predator that kills the other balls on contact.
      </p>

      <p>
        To further confuse matters, the green and pink balls are created with a preset behaviour relative to the predator (red ball). 
        They move differently, dependant on how near the predator is to them. This is achieved by making their movement follow 2 gaussian functions (one parallel, the other perpendicular to the predator) on distance to the predator with the coefficients set to random numbers.
        </p>
      
      <p>
        The green and pink balls can also mate, when they hit a ball of the opposite 'sex'. The newly created ball takes the average of each pair of gaussian coefficients of its parents.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        As can be seen, after a while the balls naturally get good at avoiding the predator, due to the fact that the ones that avoided it best got to breed the longest/most.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Music site </h3><a class="link" alt="The place for Michal Paszkiewicz's music" href="http://www.michalpaszkiewicz.co.uk/MusicSite/">Link</a>
      <p>A simple site I have started creating for myself, where I should be able to post all my recordings... once I have actually recorded anything...</p>

      <h3>Cryptosaurus </h3><a class="link" alt="Cracking codes!" href="http://www.michalpaszkiewicz.co.uk/Cryptosaurus/">Link</a>
      <p>This is a project I have been meaning to do for a while. While at university, when I was learning C, I had created a fun cryptography console tool. But my laptop was stolen and unfortunately I had not backed my work up anywhere. It wasn't particularly amazing and only covered a small amount of cryptographic functions.</p>

      <p>But since then, I have been keen on remaking the tool. Now, with more programming skills gained, I have started again. I will slowly start with remaking what I had, then working on more complex functions. I am especially looking to allow the tool to delve into steganography.</p>

      <p>While all the basic functions will be built in javascript, the aim is to use MVC for the later part of this project. Obviously because I would like to learn to use MVC.</p>

      <h3>Raspberry Pi</h3>
      <p>I have also recently acquired a Raspberry Pi, which means I will slowly start looking at projects to do with this. I will keep this blog updated.</p>
